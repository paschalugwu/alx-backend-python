# Project README

## Project Overview
This project focuses on Python Variable Annotations and aims to enhance your understanding of type annotations in Python 3.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain type annotations in Python 3
- Utilize type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Understand Duck typing
- Validate your code with MyPy

## Requirements
### General
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should follow pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`
- Modules, classes, and functions should have proper documentation

## Tasks
### Task 0: Basic annotations - add
- Write a type-annotated function `add` that takes two float arguments and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 1: Basic annotations - concat
- Write a type-annotated function `concat` that concatenates two strings and returns the result.

### Task 2: Basic annotations - floor
- Write a type-annotated function `floor` that returns the floor of a float.

### Task 3: Basic annotations - to string
- Write a type-annotated function `to_str` that converts a float to its string representation.

### Task 4: Define variables
- Define and annotate specific variables with given values.

### Task 5: Complex types - list of floats
- Write a function `sum_list` that takes a list of floats and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 6: Complex types - mixed list
- Write a function `sum_mixed_list` that takes a list of integers and floats, returning their sum as a float.

### Task 7: Complex types - string and int/float to tuple
- Write a function `to_kv` that takes a string and an int/float, returning a tuple with the string and the square of the int/float.

### Task 8: Complex types - functions
- Write a function `make_multiplier` that returns a function to multiply a float by a given multiplier.

### Task 9: Let's duck type an iterable object
- Annotate a function `element_length` to return a list of tuples containing elements and their lengths.
